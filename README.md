## Inspiration
Lack of 3D printing access in the community.


## What it does
App for sharing printing devices across the community. Whether it is a 3D printer or 3D printer, this platform allows all users to share their devices. 3D Printing is a new technology, and is not easily accessible to all interested users. This platform removes that barrier and allows easy access to such devices. Especially in times like this, where 3D printing can be leveraged to create critical supplies for essential workers.

## How I built it
Our team utilized **Flutter**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, **Firebase Authentication**, and **Firebase Functions** to build this sharing platform.

## Challenges I ran into

We ran in to many challenges trying to use the Google Maps API for the first time and setting it up with flutter. We also ran in to a couple challenges uploading to a firebase database. Requesting worked well nonetheless. It was a challenge making the UI looks nice while keeping it functional.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Successfully being able to integrate the backend functions into our client, and dynamically populating data in the app

## What I learned
Through this project, our team was able to learn together, and learn from each others experiences form before and during this hackathon:


1. Flutter, page routing, authentication flows
2. Writing serverless functions and triggers
3. App prototyping and mock ups through Figma


## What's next for PrinterShare
PrinterShare can be expanded to be a sharing platform for not just printers, but for generally any item or task. The existing logic in place can be modified to support varies other tasks/jobs such as maintenance and other personal services.
